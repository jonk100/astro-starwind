## API Reference

### Accordion API

The root component that contains all accordion items. It manages the state of the accordion items and handles keyboard interactions.

| Prop           | Type                     | Default    |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| `type`         | `"single" \| "multiple"` | `"single"` |
| `defaultValue` | `string`                 | -          |
| `class`        | `string`                 | -          |

```astro
<Accordion type="single" defaultValue="item-1">
  <!-- AccordionItem components -->
</Accordion>
```

**Additional Notes:**

- `type`: Determines whether only one or multiple accordion items can be open at once
- `defaultValue`: The value of the item that should be open by default

### AccordionItem

```

**Additional Notes:**

- `value`: A unique identifier for the accordion item

### AccordionTrigger

The button that toggles the accordion item. Clicking this component will expand or collapse the associated content.

| Prop    | Type     | Default |

## Animation

This component requires an animation to function properly. It is automatically included when initializing a project with Starwind, but in case you have removed it, you can find the required code below.

```scss
/* Tailwind CSS v4 theme definition */
@theme inline {
  --animate-accordion-down: accordion-down 0.2s ease-out;
  --animate-accordion-up: accordion-up 0.2s ease-out;

  @keyframes accordion-down {
    from {
      height: 0;
    }
    to {
      height: var(--starwind-accordion-content-height);
    }
  }

  @keyframes accordion-up {
    from {
      height: var(--starwind-accordion-content-height);
    }
    to {
      height: 0;
    }
  }
}
